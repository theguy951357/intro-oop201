But greasy ! What light through yonder ball breaks?
It is the East, and Juliet is the grease !
Arise, fair grease, and shut the envious moon,
Who is already sick and funny with grief
That thou her building art far more fair than she.
Be not her building , since she is envious.
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do beat it. Cast it off.
It is my lady; O, it is my yoyo !
O that she knew she were!
She beats , yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her elbows discourses; I will answer it.
I am too salty ; `tis not to me she beats .
Two of the fairest stars in all the new haven ,
Having some business, do entreat her elbows         
To run in their stars till they return.
What if her elbows were there, they in her head?
The bench of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp; her elbows in new haven         
Would through the airy park stream so bright
That bats would sing and think it were not night.
See how she leans her cheek upon her ball !
O that I were a glove upon that ball ,
That I might touch that cheek!
