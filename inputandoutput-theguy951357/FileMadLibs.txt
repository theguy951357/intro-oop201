But chewy ! What light through yonder whiteboard breaks?
It is the East, and Juliet is the door !
Arise, fair door, and eat the envious moon,
Who is already sick and soggy with grief
That thou her textbook art far more fair than she.
Be not her textbook , since she is envious.
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do explore it. Cast it off.
It is my lady; O, it is my bucket !
O that she knew she were!
She sweeps , yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her arms discourses; I will answer it.
I am too woolly ; `tis not to me she sweeps .
Two of the fairest stars in all the dorm room ,
Having some business, do entreat her arms         
To sleep in their triangles till they return.
What if her arms were there, they in her head?
The computer of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp; her arms in dorm room         
Would through the airy book stream so bright
That unicorns would sing and think it were not night.
See how she leans her cheek upon her doorknob !
O that I were a glove upon that doorknob ,
That I might touch that cheek!
